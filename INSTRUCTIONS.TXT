Thank you for downloading oobabooga/text-generation-webui.

# Installation

Run the "start" script. If all goes right, it should take care of
everything for you.

To launch the web UI in the future after it is already installed, run
the same "start" script.

# Updating the web UI

Run the "update" script. This will only install the updates, so it should
be much faster than the initial installation.

# Adding flags like --chat, --notebook, etc

Edit the "webui.py" script using a text editor and add the desired flags
to the CMD_FLAGS variable at the top. It should look like this:

CMD_FLAGS = '--chat'

For instance, to add the --api flag, change it to

CMD_FLAGS = '--chat --api'

# Running an interactive shell

To run an interactive shell in the miniconda environment, run the "cmd"
script. This is useful for installing additional requirements manually.

# Using an AMD GPU in Linux

Requires ROCm SDK 5.4.2 or 5.4.3 to be installed.
Some systems may also need: sudo apt-get install libstdc++-12-dev

Edit the "webui.py" script using a text editor and un-comment and modify the
lines near the top of the script according to your setup. In particular, modify
the os.environ["ROCM_PATH"] = '/opt/rocm' line to point to your ROCm installation.
