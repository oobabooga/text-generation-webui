## Parameters tab

### Generation

These parameters control the text generation. 

This tab contains two main text boxes: Input, where you enter your prompt, and Output, where the model output will appear.

#### Input

The number on the lower right of the Input box counts the number of tokens in the input. It gets updated whenever you update the input text as long as a model is loaded (otherwise there is no tokenizer to count the tokens).

Below the Input box, the following buttons can be found:

* **Generate**: starts a new generation.
* **Stop**: causes an ongoing generation to be stopped as soon as a the next token after that is generated.
* **Continue**: starts a new generation taking as input the text in the Output box.

In the **Prompt** menu, you can select from some predefined prompts defined under `text-generation-webui/prompts`. The 💾 button saves your current input as a new prompt, the 🗑️ button deletes the selected prompt, and the 🔄 button refreshes the list. If you come up with an interesting prompt for a certain task, you are welcome to submit it to the repository in a Pull Request.

#### Output

Four tabs can be found:

* **Raw**: where the raw text generated by the model appears.
* **Markdown**: it contains a "Render" button. You can click on it at any time to render the current output as markdown. This is particularly useful for models that generate LaTeX equations like GALACTICA.
* **HTML**: displays the output in an HTML style that is meant to be more pleasing to read. Its style is defined under `text-generation-webui/css/html_readable_style.css`, and improvements to this style are welcome.
* **Logits**: when you click on "Get next token probabilities", this tab displays the 25 most likely next tokens based on your current input and their probabilities. If "Use samplers" is checked, the probabilities will be the the ones after the parameters in the "Parameters" tab are applied. Otherwise, they will be the raw probabilities generated by the model.

### Notebook tab

Precisely the same thing as the Default tab, with the difference that the output appears in the same text box as the input.
